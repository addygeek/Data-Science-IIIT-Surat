# Unique Data Analysis using Python

This project demonstrates how to analyze a dataset to extract unique insights using Python and pandas. It includes techniques for identifying unique values, counting occurrences, summarizing data, detecting outliers, and saving processed data for further analysis.

## Features

1. **Unique Value Identification**:
   - Find unique customers and products in a dataset.

2. **Frequency Analysis**:
   - Count the occurrences of each product and identify rare products purchased only once.

3. **Category Analysis**:
   - Group data by categories to compute total amounts, average amounts, and transaction counts.

4. **Outlier Detection**:
   - Use the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to detect outliers in transaction amounts.

5. **Unique Combinations**:
   - Identify unique combinations of customers and products.

6. **Data Export**:
   - Save processed data to a CSV file for further use.
