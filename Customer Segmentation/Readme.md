# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

This project demonstrates customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm. Customer segmentation is a core application in data science, commonly used in marketing and retail analytics to group customers based on behavioral patterns like income and spending scores.

## Features

1. **Standardize Data**:
   - Scales features to have zero mean and unit variance for optimal clustering.

2. **K-Means Clustering**:
   - Groups customers into clusters based on their similarity.

3. **Dimensionality Reduction**:
   - Uses PCA to visualize customer clusters in a 2D plot.

4. **Save Results**:
   - Exports the segmented dataset as `customer_segments.csv`.
