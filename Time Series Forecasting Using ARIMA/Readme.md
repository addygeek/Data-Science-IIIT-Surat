# Time Series Forecasting Using ARIMA

This project demonstrates time series forecasting using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. Time series forecasting is widely used in finance, retail, and many other industries to predict future trends.

## Features

1. **Data Visualization**:
   - Plots the original time series data for analysis.

2. **ARIMA Model**:
   - Fits an ARIMA model to the time series for forecasting.

3. **Forecasting**:
   - Predicts future values based on the fitted model.

4. **Error Metrics**:
   - Evaluates the performance of the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

5. **Save Forecast**:
   - Exports the forecast to a CSV file for further analysis.
